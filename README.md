# dove_keyboard_hw
Fusion 360 and Step Files to create your own Dove Keyboard.
Please look at the [dove_keyboard_fw](https://github.com/pragun/dove_keyboard_fw) for the firmware.

Hardware used:
1. 14 M2x8mm screws for the top_case.
2. [Mars colony XDA keycap set](https://ymdkey.com/products/moon-landing-mars-colony-xda-profile-pbt-121-165-keys-dye-sub-keycap-set-suitable-for-mx-switches-mechanical-keyboard?variant=31875409903677)
3. The parts can be printed on a printer capable of printing 220mm x 200mm. I use a 0.6mm nozzle.
4. I used Inland Green PLA+ for the accent parts and Inland BoneWhite PLA+ filament for all the other parts.
5. Uses a STM32F407 board. I used one like [this](https://stm32-base.org/boards/STM32F407VGT6-STM32F4XX-M). Probably the best place to buy one would be AliExpress.
